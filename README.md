# 📊 Big Mart Sales Prediction

Welcome to the *Big Mart Sales Prediction* project! This project utilizes *Machine Learning* techniques to predict sales based on various product and store-related attributes.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Big Mart is a retail store chain with multiple outlets. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate sales for different products based on features such as store location, item type, and visibility.

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset consists of various attributes related to products and stores:
- *Item_Identifier*: Unique product ID
- *Item_Weight*: Weight of the product
- *Item_Fat_Content*: Fat content category (Low Fat, Regular, etc.)
- *Outlet_Identifier*: Unique store ID
- *Outlet_Size*: Store size (Small, Medium, Large)
- *Item_Outlet_Sales*: Sales amount (Target variable)

## 🔧 Installation & Dependencies
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:
bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Ensure that Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE is set up for execution.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. *Importing Dependencies* 📥
   - Load necessary libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
2. *Data Collection & Processing* 📊
   - Load dataset, check for missing values, and handle categorical data.
3. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* 🔍
   - Visualizing relationships between different variables.
4. *Feature Engineering* 🛠️
   - Handling missing values and transforming features for better predictions.
5. *Model Building & Evaluation* 🤖
   - Train models such as *Linear Regression, **Random Forest*, etc.
   - Evaluate models using RMSE and R² Score.
6. *Results & Interpretation* 📈
   - Understanding the impact of different variables on sales.

## 📊 Results & Insights
- The sales are highly dependent on *Item Type* and *Outlet Size*.
- Discounted items showed varying sales trends based on the store category.
- *Random Forest* performed better compared to Linear Regression with a lower RMSE score.
